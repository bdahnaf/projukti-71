# projukti-71
This is a tutorial site for UVA problem solvers. They can find the UVA solutions and the algorithms and discuss the problems.

History:
This is the very first project of my web-development life collborated with my friend Md. Mizanur Rahman Riyadh. We used to solve acm back then and struggled to find a website which is dedicated for the problem solvers where they can see how a problem can be solved or even see the solution if they cannot accomplish. So we came up with the idea of building such site and this was the result.
We bought a domain projukti71.com which is not continued after one year as we didn't have the money for the hosting purpose.

I hope you guys enjoy.
